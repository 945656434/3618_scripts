# 3618_scripts

This is a collection of R projects and script files to be used by Math and Actuarial Science majors at The Ohio State University who are currently taking Math 3618: Theory of Interest.  It will be divided in two pieces: Introduction to R and financial math scripts.

## Downloads

There are several items that will want (or need) to download to run these scripts as intended:

### R interpreter and IDE

* You can get the RStudio IDE, freely available at [rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/) and the R Interpreter, also freely available at [rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/).  You will need RStudio to run the .Rproj files that organize our script files, at least.

* Alternatively, the Anaconda Data Science distribution has both of these files already, and it is freely available at [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  This is a very large download due to all of the packages and IDEs it includes for both R and Python, and it even has its own command line interface, file organization, and update schemes to keep it away from the rest of your system.

### GitHub interaction

While you can download this repository as a .zip file to get all of the files on your machine, getting updates to the files could make your life difficult.  I recommend that you get some sort of app 

* The simplest option is GitHub Desktop, available at [github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)

* You may alternatively/additionally get Git for Windows (or Mac), if you prefer the command line to a graphical interface.  It is available at [gitforwindows.org/](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  Rstudio has an option to integrate with Git, but I won't be using it.  Linux systems should already have a version of Git installed.

To use these apps with GitHub, you will likely need to register for a GitHub account.  If you do this, please make sure to choose a professional-looking username.  If you decide to post code to GitHub, anyone with internet access will be able to look at what you wrote.  This should be a good thing, but names like "xXxAlucArdXdrAculAxXx" don't really scream "I am a responsible adult who should be trusted with responsibility over something that matters."

## Intro to R

This part of the repository will consist of several scripts and data files intended to be used to get started with using R quickly.  It is intended that you will run through the scripts, and then keep them on hand as a reference for solving problems.  You should not copy and paste from these files!  Retyping the commands yourself will help you remember what syntax is supposed to go where.

## 3618 Scripts

This part of the course will consist of several projects related to different parts of Math 3618.  I will try to include references to the appropriate parts of the Intro to R section, but I make no guarantees.  Exercises here will usually include sample code for similar problems to help you get started.
