# 3618_scripts

This is a collection of R projects and script files to be used by Math and Actuarial Science majors at The Ohio State University who are currently taking Math 3618: Theory of Interest.  It will be divided in two pieces: Introduction to R and financial math scripts.

## Intro to R

This part of the repository will consist of several scripts and data files intended to be used to get started with using R quickly.  It is intended that you will run through the scripts, and then keep them on hand as a reference for solving problems.  You should not copy and paste from these files!  Retyping the commands yourself will help you remember what syntax is supposed to go where.

## 3618 Scripts

This part of the course will consist of several projects related to different parts of Math 3618.  I will try to include references to the appropriate parts of the Intro to R section, but I make no guarantees.  Exercises here will usually include sample code for similar problems to help you get started.
